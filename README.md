## Summary

Blogu is a blogging application with featured and recent posts, categories, full markdown articles, author information, comments, and much more.

What's best of all is that you or your clients can manage the blog from a dedicated Content Management System. Built with technologies such as Next.JS, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, and Vercel.

## Learning Goals

1. Advanced React.JS and Next.JS best practices
