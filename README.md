# Blogu

## Summary

Blogu is a blogging application with featured and recent posts, categories, full markdown articles, author information, comments, and much more.

What's best of all is that you or your clients can manage the blog from a dedicated Content Management System. Built with technologies such as Next.JS, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, and Vercel.

## Learning Goals

1. Advanced React.JS and Next.JS best practices
1. Use of Next.JS pre-rendering with static site generation
1. Learn how to create a modern UI using Tailwind CSS

The project also puts into practice proper management of Git by organizing code into development, staging and production branches so that there is always a version of the code ready to go.

Finally, the repetitive process of building and deploying the project to production is automated by deployment to Vercel Hosting.
